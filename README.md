## Overview

### The project

In this project I developed a functional card game where the user can add and remove customised cards, view the full deck and play.

The main habilities practiced here were:

- stateFull and controled components

- Render components based on it's state

- Update components state

- Capture events with React syntax

- Develop forms using JSX syntax

- Pass information from child components to its parent through callBacks
